# Comet Hunters

Comet Hunters is a site for those who wish to explore the cosmos as close as possible without having to be an actual astronomer. The main idea is to aid those who might have the desire to learn and explore but lack the means to do so. The club organizes trips across the globe and takes care of food, lodging, equipment and planning so that those who sign up can focus on peering into the vastness of space. The focus is as much on learning as it is having fun, and the most important thing, regardless of which package you choose, will always be to create beautiful memories.

Those who wish to sign up can choose from three different premade packages. The differences in the packages lies in the number of locations you get to visit and what resources will be at your disposal throughout the journey. They, of course, also differ in price range because of this, and having three different packages will ensure that most people will be able to find a package that matches their level of interest and capital.

## Features

* Navigation Bar
  - A fully responsive navigation bar with a logo, that when clicked takes the user back to the main page, as well as separate links to the three different parts of the site.
  - It appears on all pages and remains the same regardless of which page the user is on, which makes navigation easy and prevents the user from getting lost.
  - Removes the need to use the browser's built-in "back" and "forward" buttons.

  - Spurs the users interest by giving examples of travel destinations and some perks that are available without revealing everything.

  - Every picture has a description beneath it that tells the user where the picture was taken.

## Testing

* The site has been tested on the following browsers: Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
* I can confirm that the entire site is responsive and adapts to all common screen sizes.
* I can confirm that every piece of text, as well as the form and the navigation links, are readable and easy to understand.
* I have tested all of the links and can confirm that they are working as intended (external links opening in new tabs etc.).
* I can confirm that the form is working as intended: it lets the user know what information is required, the email input only accepts a valid email format, the submit button works as intended and the correct information is sent to the server.
